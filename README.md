# titanic
i have done this project  with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set 
I'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.  implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

i'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning
